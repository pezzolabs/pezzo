<Tip>
  If you don't wish to run Pezzo locally, you can use [Pezzo
  Cloud](https://app.pezzo.ai) instead. Pezzo Cloud is a fully managed version
  of Pezzo that is hosted and managed by the Pezzo team.
</Tip>

## Clone the repository

First, clone the Pezzo repository from GitHub and then navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pezzolabs/pezzo.git
cd pezzo
```

## Add the necessary environmental variables

Append the environmental variables from the `apps/` folder to the root directory

```bash
cat apps/server/.env >> .env.local
cat apps/console/.env >> .env.local
## Running with Docker Compose

Run the following command to start the Pezzo stack:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This command will spin up all infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.) and the Pezzo components (Server, Console). It will also automatically apply database migration to the PostgreSQL database.

Once the stack is up and running, you can access the Pezzo Console at http://localhost:4200. ðŸš€
