# Features

üéõÔ∏è **Centralized Prompt Management**: Manage all AI prompts in one place for maximum visibility and efficiency.

üöÄ **Streamlined Prompt Design, Publishing & Versioning:** Create, edit, test and publish prompts with ease.

üîç **Observability**: Access detailed prompt execution history, stats and metrics (duration, prompt cost, completion cost, etc.) for better insights.

üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting:** Effortlessly resolve issues with your prompts. Time travel to retroactively fine-tune failed prompts and commit the fix instantly.

üí∞ **Cost Transparency**: Gain comprehensive cost transparency across all prompts and AI models.

üí° **Simplified Integration:** Reduce code overhead by 90% by consuming your AI prompts using the Pezzo Client, regardless of the model provider.

# Documentation

[Click here to navigate to the Official Pezzo Documentation](https://docs.pezzo.ai/).

In the documentation, you can find information on how to use Pezzo, its architecture, as well as a tutorial for getting up and running with a simple demo app.

# Getting Started - Development

This section is useful for contributors who want to run Pezzo locally in development mode.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker
- (Recommended) [GraphQL Language Feature Support VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql)

### Install dependencies

Install NPM dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

### Spin up development dependencies via Docker Compose

Pezzo relies on Postgres, [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) and [Supertokens](https://supertokens.com/). You can spin it up using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

### Start Pezzo

Generate the Prisma client:

```
npx nx prisma:generate server
```

Deploy Prisma migrations:

```
npx dotenv-cli -e apps/server/.env -- npx prisma migrate deploy --schema apps/server/prisma/schema.prisma
```

Run the server:

```
npx nx serve server
```

The server is now running. In the background, [graphql-codegen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-codegen/cli) has generated GraphQL types based on the actual schema. These can be found at [libs/graphql/src/@generated](libs/graphql/src/@generated). This provides excellent type safety across the monorepo.

In development mode, you want to run `graphql-codegen` in watch mode, so whenever you make changes to the schema, types are generated automatically. In a separate Terminal tab, run:

```
npm run graphql:codegen:watch
```

Finally, you are ready to run the Pezzo Console:

```
npx nx serve console
```

That's it! Pezzo is now accessible at http://localhost:4200 üöÄ
