# Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:pezzolabs/pezzo.git
```

## 🐳 Option 1: Running Pezzo via Docker Compose

This is a straightforward way to run Pezzo and start using it.

Simply run the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

Pezzo should now be accessible at https://localhost:4200 🚀

## 🕹️ Option 2: Running Pezzo in Development Mode

This method is useful for contirbutors and developers.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker
- (Recommended) [GraphQL Language Feature Support VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql)

### Install dependencies

Install NPM dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

### Spin up development dependencies via Docker Compose

Pezzo relies on Postgres and [Supertokens](https://supertokens.com/). You can spin it up using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

### Start Pezzo

Generate the Prisma client:

```
npx nx prisma:generate server
```

Deploy Prisma migrations:

```
npx dotenv-cli -e apps/server/.env -- npx prisma migrate deploy --schema apps/server/prisma/schema.prisma
```

Run the server:

```
npx nx serve server
```

The server is now running. In the background, [graphql-codegen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-codegen/cli) has generated GraphQL types based on the actual schema. These can be found at [libs/graphql/src/@generated](libs/graphql/src/@generated). This provides excellent type safety across the monorepo.

In development mode, you want to run `graphql-codegen` in watch mode, so whenever you make changes to the schema, types are generated automatically. In a separate Terminal tab, run:

```
npx nx graphql:codegen graphql --watch
```

Finally, you are ready to run the Pezzo Console:

```
npx nx serve console
```

That's it! Pezzo is now accessible at http://localhost:4200 🚀
