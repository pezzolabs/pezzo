title: "Pezzo Client - Python"

The Pezzo client is a PyPi that allows you to easily integrate your application with Pezzo.

## Getting Started

### Intall the Pezzo Client

Install the [pezzo](https://pypi.org/project/pezzo/) package from PyPi:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pip
  pip install pezzo
  ``` 
  ```bash poetry
  poetry add pezzo
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Initialize the Pezzo Client

To initialize the Pezzo client, simply import it into your script. It will automatically read the configuration from your environment variables:
- `PEZZO_API_KEY`: Your Pezzo API key
- `PEZZO_PROJECT_ID`: Your Pezzo project ID
- `PEZZO_ENVIRONMENT`: The environment you want to use (e.g. `Production`, which is the default environment created by Pezzo)

<CodeGroup>
```py main.py
from pezzo.client import pezzo
```
</CodeGroup>

In the above example, we created a `libs/pezzo.ts` file in which we instantiate the Pezzo client and export it. We can then import it in other areas of our application.
