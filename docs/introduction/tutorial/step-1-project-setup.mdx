## Sign in to Pezzo

First, make sure you have a Pezzo account. Simply head over to [Pezzo Cloud](https://app.pezzo.ai) and sign up.

## Create a new Project

If this is your first time using Pezzo, you will go through a quick onboarding flow, and the end of which you will have a new project. You can call this project however you want. We will call it *"Tutorial"*.

After creating your project, select it. Now you will see the **Prompts** page. In Pezzo, Prompts are created at the project level.
