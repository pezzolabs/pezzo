## What are we building?
We're going to build an AI-powered Fact Machine that can provide you with facts about anything in the world. This will involve:

- Creating a Pezzo project
- Creating a prompt
- Basic Prompt Engineering
- Testing your prompt in the Pezzo Platform
- Committing and publishing your prompt
- Consuming your prompt using TypeScript

A prompt such as this can power user interfaces and entire user experiences. For example, our [Simple Demo App](https://github.com/pezzolabs/pezzo/tree/main/examples) uses a prompt just like this!
