The Prompt Editor is where you can edit your prompt content and settings.

When selecting a prompt from the Prompts page, you will be met with the Prompt view, which contains multiple tabs. The main tab is the **Prompt Editor**.

## Prompt Content

On the left-hand side you will find a text area. This is where you can write the content of your prompt.

<Tip>
You can specify variables using curly braces, which allows you to dynamically replace values when calling the LLM provider using the Pezzo Client. For example - `{name}`.

## Prompt Settings

On the right-hand side you will find the settings for your prompt. The first setting is the provider. Currently, Pezzo supports the following:
- OpenAI Chat Completion
- Azure OpenAI Chat Completion (Coming Soon)
- Anthropic (Coming Soon)

After selecting the provider, a set of settings will appear which are specific to that provider. You can tune these settings and commit them in a specific version, so they are automatically fetched by the Pezzo Client.
