Pezzo allows you to create multiple versions of your prompts and deploy them to your environments.

## Commiting a New Version

After making changes to a prompt, you can commit a new version by clicking the **Commit** button in the top right corner of the prompt editor. A pop-up will appear, where you will provide a commit message.

After confirming, a new version will be created and is ready for deployment.

## Publishing a Version

To publish a version, click the **Publish** button in the top right corner of the prompt editor. A pop-up will appear, where you will select the environment you want to deploy to.

After clicking **Publish**, the prompt will be deployed to the selected environment instantly.

<Note>
The ability to instantly publish changes is powerful. However, it can lead to issues if you are not careful. It is advised to set up a pre-production environment to test your changes before deploying to Production. [Learn about Environments in Pezzo](/platform/prompt-management/environments).
</Note>

## Rolling Back a Version

You can always publish an older version of a prompt. To do this, simply click on the version selector in the editor and select the desired version. Then, publish as usual.
