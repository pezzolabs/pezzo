# Prompt Metrics

<Note>
We are in the process of moving the Metrics view to be at the Project level. Until then, Metrics are only available for users who manage their prompts with Pezzo. [Learn more about Prompt Management with Pezzo](/platform/prompt-management).
</Note>
<Tip>
If you feel that there are metrics that are missing, please let us know by [creating an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pezzolabs/pezzo/issues).
</Tip>

If you manage your prompts with Pezzo, you are able to view insights and metrics for a specific prompt.
